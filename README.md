Valorant match analysis featuring FNATIC Boaster from data at Tracker.gg https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/FNATIC%20Boaster%231010/overview

I noticed there was a large amount of JSON returned from each Valorant match at Tracker.gg and was curious what player analytics I could glean from the data.  I break down the various data types returned and specifically focus on round-by-round player performance and also how loadouts relate to player performance.
