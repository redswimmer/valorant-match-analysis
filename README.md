### Valorant match analysis featuring FNATIC Boaster 

I noticed there was a large amount of JSON returned from each Valorant match on Tracker.gg and was curious what player analytics I could glean from the data.  I break down the various data types returned and specifically focus on player performance including:

- Round-by-round player performance
- How loadouts affect player performance
- Round win predictions using random forest
- Selecting the "best features" for round predictions

Match data is based on a single match from [FNATIC Boaster Tracker Profile](https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/FNATIC%20Boaster%231010/overview)
